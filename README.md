## üìñ Introduction
This project focuses on two distinct tasks using deep learning techniques:
1. **Human Activity Recognition using Accelerometer Data**
2. **Pneumonia Detection using Chest X-ray Images**

The goal is to build and evaluate neural network models to achieve high accuracy for both classification problems.

## üìä Datasets
- **Human Activity Recognition**: The dataset consists of accelerometer readings to classify human activities such as walking, sitting, and running. [Download the dataset here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ciwzKIPl1n7otcWQTYVX-j1k3TYmVeGL/view?usp=sharing).
- **Pneumonia Detection**: The dataset includes grayscale chest X-ray images categorized as either 'Normal' or 'Pneumonia'. [Download the dataset here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ciwzKIPl1n7otcWQTYVX-j1k3TYmVeGL/view?usp=sharing).

## üõ† Feature Selection
### Human Activity Recognition
- **Feature Extraction**: Selected 15 relevant features from accelerometer data (e.g., mean, standard deviation).
- **Feature Normalization**: All features were normalized to ensure balanced input to the model.
- **Feature Selection Method**: Utilized `SelectKBest` for selecting the most impactful features.

### Pneumonia Detection
- Used raw pixel data from grayscale chest X-ray images resized to 64x64 pixels for input.

## üß† Model Architecture
### Human Activity Recognition Model
- **Input**: Accelerometer data after feature selection.
- **Architecture**: 
  - 4 hidden layers starting with 512 neurons and reducing by half in each subsequent layer.
  - Output layer uses Softmax activation for multi-class classification.
- **Training**: 
  - Trained for 50 epochs using Adam optimizer.
  - Monitored accuracy and loss for both training and validation sets.

### Pneumonia Detection Model (CNN)
- **Input**: Grayscale images of size 64x64.
- **Architecture**:
  - 2 Convolutional Layers with Average Pooling.
  - Flattening followed by 3 Dense Layers (120, 84, 10 neurons).
  - Output layer with Sigmoid activation for binary classification.
- **Training**:
  - Trained for 50 epochs using Adam optimizer.

## üìà Training and Evaluation
- **Data Splitting**:
  - Train: 80%
  - Validation: 10%
  - Test: 10%
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
- **Tools**: Used `scikit-learn` for evaluation metrics and `matplotlib` for visualizations.

### Human Activity Recognition
- **Training Accuracy**: 90.30%
- **Validation Accuracy**: 90.51%
- **Test Accuracy**: 90.8%
- **Test Loss**: 19.7%

### Pneumonia Detection
- **Test Accuracy**: 96.07%
- **Misclassification**: 3 out of 20 samples.

## üìä Results
### Human Activity Recognition
- The model achieved a good balance between training and validation accuracy, indicating no overfitting.
- **Final Metrics**:
  - **Train Accuracy**: 0.9030
  - **Validation Accuracy**: 0.9051
  - **Test Accuracy**: 0.9084
  - **Test Loss**: 0.1971

### Pneumonia Detection
- The CNN model performed well with high accuracy on unseen test data.
- **Test Accuracy**: 96.07%
- The model only misclassified 3 out of 20 samples during testing.
